# PortalBlitz-JungleEdition

 Welcome to Portal Blitz: Jungle Edition! The
 ultimate multiplayer networking game where
 you and your friend will be transported to a
 challenging platformer world. Your mission?
 Clear the level by defeating all enemies and
 making sure you clear them faster to become
 the champion of the jungle!

Mechanics: 
 As a player, you wil use the ASWD keys to
 move around the platformer world. The A and
 D keys are for horizontal movement, while the
 W and S keys are for vertical movement. You
 can jump with the SPACE bar and attack with
 the LEFT CLICK of the mouse. For a powerful
 dash-attack, use the RIGHT CLICK of the
 mouse. Keep in mind that your health and
 stamina wil decrease when you take damage
 from enemies and use a dash-attack
 respectively, so use them wisely!

 To win each level, you must eliminate al the
 enemies. There are different enemies in each
 level, and they have different attack
 animations to deal damage to you. You can
 do this by attacking them with your sword
 while avoiding their attacks. You can also use
 your dash-attack to quickly move through
 enemies and deal damage to them. However,
 using the dash-attack wil consume your
 stamina, so use it sparingly. Also, cannons in
 the game fires cannon bals and cannot be
 dealt with so make sure to avoid their fires.
 Keep an eye on your health bar; if it becomes
 empty, you wil die and lose the game. You can
 restore your both your health and stamina by
 colecting health potions scattered hidden in
 boxes throughout the level. Use your attack
 to destroy these boxes and get them.

 Be carefull not to fall into traps or water, or
 you' l suffer the same fate. You will
 immediately die when you fall into them but
 you can avoid traps by jumping over them or
 using your dash-attack to quickly move past
 above them. In the game, you can win by killing
 all enemies and completing the level faster so
 see with your friend who can kil more
 enemies and clear the level the faster. 
 
 Are you ready to take on the jungle? Let the
 Portal Blitz begin!
